# sqlalchemy-challenge

This project consisted of querying data from a precompiled data base from hawaii.sqlite, and being able to serve the results through a local API with the library of SQLAlchemy + Flask. 

**concepts utilized on the project:** <br />
<ul>
<li>Extracting data from SQLite (precompiled databases) files</li>
<br>Communicate between Postgres and Python/Jupyter Notebook <br />
<br>Query through databases with SQLAlchemy<br />
<br>Creating an app.py to also be able to query the Database + send make it be able to send API calls.<br />
<br>Be able to load data efficently from the ETL process <br />
</ul>

  **First opinon of settuping up the code:**
  
  This has been the most tedious challenge in my coding experience so far, understanding how the connection/engines work with SQL proved to be difficult for me, but after some time of practice, I was able to use the concept efficently, but still trying to understand it more in depth.
